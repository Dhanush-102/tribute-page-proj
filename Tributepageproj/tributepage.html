            <ul>
                <li><b>1897 -</b> Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January, 1897 in Cuttack (Orissa) to
                    Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi.</li>
                <li><b>1921 -</b> Subhash Chandra Bose was a brilliant student. He passed his B.A. in Philosophy from
                    the Presidency College in Calcutta. He was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda's teachings and
                    was known for his patriotic zeal as a student. In an incident where Bose beat up his professor (E.F.
                    Otten) for his racist remarks, brought him notoriety as a rebel-Indian in eyes of the government.
                    His father wanted Netaji to become a civil servant and therefore, sent him to England to appear for
                    the Indian Civil Service Examination. Bose was placed fourth with highest marks in English. But his
                    urge for participating in the freedom movement was intense and in April 1921, he resigned from the
                    coveted Indian Civil Service and came back to India. In December 1921, Bose was arrested and
                    imprisoned for organizing a boycott of the celebrations to mark the Prince of Wales' visit to India.
                </li>
                <li><b>1922 -</b> Initially, Subhash Chandra Bose worked under the leadership of Chittaranjan Das, an
                    active member of the Congress in Calcutta. It was Chittaranjan Das, who along with Motilal Nehru,
                    left Congress and founded the Swaraj Party in 1922. Bose regarded Chittaranjan Das as his political
                    guru. He himself started the newspaper ‘Swaraj’, edited Das’ newspaper ‘Forward’ and worked as the
                    CEO of Calcutta Municipal Corporation under Das’ stint as Mayor. Subhash Chandra Bose played an
                    important role in enlightening the students, youths and labourers of Calcutta. In his fervent wait
                    to see India as an independent, federal and republic nation, he emerged as a charismatic and
                    firebrand youth icon. He was admired within the congress for his great ability in organization
                    development. He served several stints in prison for his nationalist activities during this time.
                </li>
                <li><b>1928 -</b> In 1928, during the Guwahati Session of the Congress, a difference of opinion surfaced
                    between the old and new members of the Congress. The young leaders wanted a "complete self-rule and
                    without any compromise’ while the senior leaders were in favour of the "dominion status for India
                    within the British rule".</li>
                <li><b>1937 -</b> During his stay in Berlin, He met and fell in love with Emily Schenkl, who was of
                    Austrian origin. Bose and Emily were married in 1937 in a secret Hindu ceremony.</li>
                <li><b>1939 -</b> The differences between moderate Gandhi and aggressive Subhash Chandra Bose swelled to
                    irreconcilable proportions and Bose decided to resign from the party in 1939. He went on to form the
                    Forward Bloc the same year.</li>
                <li><b>1941 -</b> Bose vehemently opposed the Congress decision to support the British during the Second
                    World War. With the aim to initiate a mass movement, Bose called out to Indians for their
                    whole-hearted participation. There was tremendous response to his call “Give me blood and I will
                    give you freedom” and the British promptly imprisoned him. In jail, he declared a hunger-srtike.
                    When his health deteriorated, the authorities, fearing violent reactions, released him but put him
                    under house-arrest.
                    In January, 1941, Subhash made a planned escape and reached Berlin, Germany via a detour through
                    Peshawar. Germans assured him their full support in his endeavours and he gained allegiance of Japan
                    as well. He took a perilous journey back east and reached Japan where he assumed command over 40,000
                    soldiers recruited from Singapore and other south East Asian regions. He called his army the ‘Indian
                    National Army’ (INA) and led the same to capture the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British
                    and rechristened it as Shaheed and Swaraj Islands. A provisional “Azad Hind Government” started
                    functioning in the captured territories.</li>
                <li><b>1942 -</b> Bose and Emily gave birth to a daughter with a name Anita.
                <li><b>1944 -</b> The INA or the Azad Hind Fauj stared for India and crossed Burma Border, and stood on
                    Indian soil on March 18, 1944.
                <li><b>1945 -</b> Netaji disappeared mysteriously soon after the retreat. It is said that he went back
                    to Singapore and met Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi, head of all military operations in South East
                    Asia who arranged for him a flight to Tokyo. He boarded a Mitsubishi Ki-21 heavy bomber from Saigon
                    Airport on August 17, 1945. The following day the bomber crashed shortly after take-off after a
                    night halt in Taiwan. Witnesses report that Bose sustained intense third degree burns in the
                    process. He succumbed to his injuries on Aug 18, 1945. He was cremated on August 20 in Taihoku
                    Crematorium and his ashes were laid to rest at the Renkji Temple of Nichiren Buddhism in Tokyo.</li>
